- Target 85%+ accuracy for receipt data extraction

### 2.2 Data Extraction Logic
- Use pattern recognition for date formats (various international formats)

### 2.3 Accuracy and Validation
- Implement confidence scoring for each extracted field
- Create validation rules for each data type (date validity, amount formatting, etc.)
- Flag low-confidence extractions for manual review
- Provide manual correction interface for extracted data

## 3. CSV File Structure and Management

### 3.1 Data Model Definition
```
receipt_id: UUID (primary key)

supplier: String (max 255 chars)
amount: Decimal (10,2 precision)
purpose: Text (unlimited length)
file_name: String (original filename)
file_path: String (Google Drive path)
last_four_digits: String (4 characters)
status: Enum ('processed', 'error', 'pending', 'review_needed')
created_at: DateTime (UTC)
updated_at: DateTime (UTC)
```

### 3.2 CSV Generation
- Generate CSV using RFC 4180 compliant formatting
