# Google Drive Receipt Parser Application - Specifications

## Project Overview
Build an application that connects to a Google Drive folder, parses receipt data from images of expenses, stores the data in a CSV file, displays the content in a web application, and allows users to download the content to their local machine.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: Which OCR service/technology should be prioritized to meet the 85%+ accuracy requirement while considering costs and privacy? → A: Tesseract.js for on-premise processing with custom training
- Q: What is the required processing model for receipt images - real-time, batch, or manual? → A: Batch process images on a scheduled basis (e.g., hourly/daily)
- Q: What is the primary target platform for the application? → A: Web-based interface only
- Q: How should receipt images be stored and managed in relation to the extracted data? → A: Keep images in Google Drive, store only URLs
- Q: What level of user access and authentication is required - single-user or multi-user system? → A: Single-user authentication only

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Google Drive Integration

- The application should support common image formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF)
- The application must handle authentication errors and refresh tokens automatically
- The application must store only URLs to images in Google Drive, not the images themselves

### 2. Receipt Data Parsing
- The application must extract the following information from receipt images:
  - Date (purchase date)
  - Supplier (merchant/business name)
  - Amount (total amount)
  - Purpose (description of purchase)
  - File Name (original image file name)
  - Last four digits of the payment card used
- The application must use Tesseract.js OCR technology for text extraction with custom training for improved accuracy
- The application should implement AI/machine learning models to improve parsing accuracy
- The application must handle various receipt formats and layouts
- The application should validate extracted data for accuracy
- The application must achieve 85%+ accuracy in data extraction

### 3. CSV File Management
- The application must create and maintain a CSV file with the following columns:
  - Date
  - Supplier
  - Amount
  - Purpose
  - File Name
  - Last Four Digits
- The CSV file should be updated automatically when new receipts are processed (batch mode)
- The application must handle CSV file conflicts and ensure data integrity
- The application should provide CSV export functionality in multiple formats if needed

### 4. Web Application Interface
- The application must provide a web-based interface accessible from multiple devices
- The web interface should display parsed receipt data in a tabular format
- The interface should include search, filter, and sorting capabilities
- The interface should allow users to view individual receipt details
- The interface should include pagination for large datasets
- The interface should provide visual indicators for processing status of receipts
- The application should include data validation and error handling in the UI
- The interface should be responsive for different device sizes

### 5. Download Functionality
- The application must allow users to download the CSV file to their local machine
- The application should support multiple download formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)
- The download should include a timestamp to indicate when the file was generated
- The application should support bulk download options for subsets of data
- The application should provide download confirmation and file size information
