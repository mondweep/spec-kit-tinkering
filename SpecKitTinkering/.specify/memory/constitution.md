# Code Quality & Performance Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards
All code must adhere to strict quality standards: Clean, readable, maintainable, and well-documented. Follow established style guides consistently. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes. Refactoring is not optional - technical debt must be addressed immediately when discovered.

### II. Testing Excellence
Testing is non-negotiable: 80%+ code coverage minimum, with critical paths at 95%+. All features must have unit, integration, and end-to-end tests before merging. Test-driven development is encouraged for new features. Tests must be fast, reliable, and deterministic.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces must maintain visual and behavioral consistency across the application. Follow established design patterns and component libraries. Consistent interaction patterns, typography, color schemes, and accessibility standards are required. User workflows must remain predictable and intuitive.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All features must meet defined performance benchmarks: Initial page load under 3 seconds, interactive response under 100ms, and acceptable resource consumption. Performance regressions are blockers. Optimization is a continuous process, not an afterthought.

### V. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
All code changes must include appropriate documentation updates. API documentation, user guides, and architectural decisions must be kept current. Knowledge sharing is required before project handoffs or when onboarding new team members.

## Additional Constraints

### Code Maintainability
- All functions should follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Maximum 50 lines per function (exceptions require justification)
- Maximum 10 parameters per function (use objects for more)
- All external dependencies must be justified and security-reviewed
- Deprecation warnings must be addressed within 30 days of release

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests must cover 100% of business logic
- Integration tests must cover all API interactions
- UI tests must cover all user workflows
- Performance tests must run with every build
- Mutation testing should be run monthly to verify test quality

### User Experience Standards
- All UI components must be responsive and mobile-friendly
- Accessibility compliance: WCAG 2.1 AA standards minimum
- Consistent loading states, error messages, and success confirmations
- Internationalization support built into all new features
- User data must be preserved across sessions appropriately

### Performance Benchmarks
- Time to Interactive: < 3 seconds on average hardware
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5 seconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1
- Bundle size: < 250KB compressed for critical path
- API response times: < 200ms for 95th percentile

## Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Requirements
- All tests must pass before committing
- Linting checks must pass
- Performance benchmarks must not regress
- Security scanning must pass
- All new code must be covered by tests

### Code Review Process
- At least one senior engineer must approve
- All automated checks must pass
- Performance impact must be evaluated
- Accessibility compliance must be verified
- UX consistency must be confirmed

### Quality Gates
- No open security vulnerabilities
- No performance regressions
- Minimum test coverage thresholds met
- All integration tests passing
- Documentation updated where required

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All changes to code, documentation, or processes must align with these principles. Deviations require explicit approval from the technical leadership team and must include justification, risk assessment, and mitigation plan.

All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these standards. The development team is responsible for maintaining these standards and escalating issues when they cannot be met.
