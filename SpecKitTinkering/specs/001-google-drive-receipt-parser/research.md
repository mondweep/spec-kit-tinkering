# Research: Google Drive Receipt Parser

## A. Technology Stack Analysis

### 1. Frontend Framework Options
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Chosen for minimal dependencies, better performance, and full control
- **Alternative considered**: React/Vue - rejected for complexity and bundle size
- **Rationale**: Project requirements specify vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with minimal libraries

### 2. OCR Solution
- **Tesseract.js**: Client-side OCR, works in browsers, can be trained for receipts
- **Google Vision API**: More accurate but requires API calls and internet
- **Choice**: Tesseract.js for offline capability and privacy compliance
- **Training**: Custom model for receipt-specific text recognition
- **Performance**: Processing time under 10 seconds per receipt image

### 3. Database Solution
- **SQLite with sql.js**: Client-side SQLite, perfect for local storage
- **IndexedDB**: Alternative, but more complex for structured data
- **Choice**: SQLite for SQL familiarity and structured querying
- **Rationale**: Matches requirements for local storage with structured metadata
- **Size**: Expected to handle 10,000+ receipts efficiently

### 4. Bundler
- **Vite**: Fast, modern build tool with HMR, good for vanilla JS
- **Webpack**: More complex, heavier for this use case
- **Choice**: Vite for speed and simplicity
- **Features**: Fast dev server, optimized builds, asset handling

### 5. Authentication
- **Google OAuth 2.0**: Required for Google Drive access
- **PKCE flow**: Enhanced security for public clients
- **Token storage**: Secure, encrypted local storage
- **Refresh mechanism**: Automatic token refresh before expiration

## B. Architecture Patterns

### 1. MVC Pattern
- **Model**: Receipt data model with CRUD operations
- **View**: HTML templates with vanilla JS DOM manipulation
- **Controller**: Application logic managing data flow

### 2. Service Layer Pattern
- **Database Service**: Abstraction over SQLite operations
- **Drive Service**: Abstraction over Google Drive API
- **OCR Service**: Abstraction over Tesseract.js operations

### 3. Component Architecture
- **Reusable components**: Login, receipt list, receipt form, etc.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Custom elements pattern without frameworks

## C. Data Flow

### 1. Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Connect to Google Drive"
2. Redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
3. Receive authorization code
4. Exchange code for access/refresh tokens
5. Store tokens securely
6. Initialize Drive API client

### 2. Receipt Processing Flow
1. User selects Google Drive folder
2. Application fetches list of images from folder
3. For each image:
   - Download image to client
   - Process through Tesseract.js OCR
   - Extract receipt data (date, supplier, amount, etc.)
   - Store in local SQLite database
4. Update UI with new receipt data

### 3. Export Flow
1. User selects export format (CSV, Excel, etc.)
2. Query SQLite database for receipt data
3. Format data according to export type
4. Generate download file

## D. Security Considerations

### 1. Token Management
- Store tokens encrypted in browser storage
- Implement automatic refresh before expiration
- Secure logout functionality

### 2. Data Privacy
- Do not store receipt images locally, only references to Google Drive
- Process all data client-side
- Use HTTPS for all communications

### 3. Input Validation
- Validate all data extracted from OCR
- Sanitize inputs before database operations
- Implement error boundaries

## E. Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of receipt images
- Virtual scrolling for large receipt lists
- Efficient database queries
- Caching strategies for Drive API calls
- Batch processing of receipts to avoid blocking UI

## F. Integration Challenges

### 1. Google Drive API
- CORS requirements for web applications
- Rate limiting considerations
- Token refresh mechanisms
- File access permissions

### 2. Tesseract.js
- Initial loading time of WASM modules
- Memory consumption during processing
- Accuracy with different receipt formats
- Training custom models for better accuracy

### 3. SQLite (sql.js)
- Initial loading of database library
- Performance with large datasets
- Browser storage limits
- Backup/restore capabilities

## G. User Experience Design

### 1. Interface Approach
- Clean, minimal design focusing on data display
- Responsive layout for multiple device sizes
- Intuitive navigation between sections
- Clear status indicators for processing

### 2. Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance

## H. Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- OCR service functions
- Database operations
- Utility functions
- Validation logic

### 2. Integration Tests
- Google Drive API integration
- Database storage/retrieval
- OCR processing pipeline

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- Complete user workflow
- Authentication flow
- Data export functionality
