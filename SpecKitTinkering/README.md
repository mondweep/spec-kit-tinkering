# SpecKit Tinkering

## Overview

This repository serves as a playground for experimenting with the SpecKit framework, which is designed for specification-driven development. The SpecKit framework provides tools and templates to create comprehensive project specifications before coding begins, ensuring all requirements are clearly defined and validated upfront.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate the usage of the SpecKit framework
- Test the workflow of creating specifications, plans, tasks, and implementations
- Document the learning process for SpecKit methodology
- Create a working example of a real application using SpecKit

## What Has Been Done So Far

### 1. Framework Setup
- SpecKit commands configured in `.qwen/commands/`
- Memory directory created for constitution and specifications
- Template files established for specs, plans, tasks, and contracts

### 2. Implemented Feature: Google Drive Receipt Parser
A complete specification-driven development exercise has been completed for a Google Drive Receipt Parser application:

#### Feature Specifications Created:
- **Specification**: Detailed requirements for an application that connects to Google Drive, parses receipt data from images, stores data in CSV format, displays data in a web app, and provides download functionality
- **Technical Plan**: Architecture decisions, technology stack (Vite, vanilla JS, SQLite, Tesseract.js)
- **Data Model**: Complete SQLite schema for receipts, user sessions, and processing logs
- **API Contracts**: Comprehensive API specifications
- **Research**: Technical analysis of implementation approaches
- **Quickstart Guide**: Setup and usage instructions
- **Tasks**: Structured implementation tasks following TDD approach

#### Key Technical Decisions:
- Frontend: Vite with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (minimal dependencies)
- Database: Client-side SQLite using sql.js for local metadata storage
- OCR Processing: Tesseract.js for client-side receipt parsing
- Authentication: Google OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow
- Architecture: Service layer pattern with vanilla JavaScript components

#### Specification Process:
- Used the `/clarify` workflow to resolve 5 key ambiguities
- Applied constitutional principles for code quality, testing, UX consistency, and performance
- Created detailed data models following SQLite schema requirements
- Established comprehensive API contracts for all functionality

### 3. SpecKit Workflow Validation
Successfully demonstrated the complete SpecKit workflow including:
- `/specify` - Creating feature specifications
- `/clarify` - Resolving ambiguities through targeted questions
- `/plan` - Generating implementation plans
- `/tasks` - Creating structured task breakdowns
- `/implement` - Executing the implementation plan conceptually

## Current State

- ‚úÖ Specification phase: **COMPLETED** - Complete specification set for Google Drive Receipt Parser
- ‚úÖ Planning phase: **COMPLETED** - Technical architecture and data models established
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation phase: **INCOMPLETE** - Services conceptualized but not fully implemented as working code
- üìÅ File Structure: `/specs/001-google-drive-receipt-parser/` contains all specification artifacts

## How to Navigate This Repository

1. **Specification Artifacts**: Look in `/specs/001-google-drive-receipt-parser/` for all the detailed specifications created for the receipt parser application

2. **Learning Documentation**: Check the Terminal-knowledge directory for comprehensive session documentation:
   - `/Terminal-knowledge/Terminal 1.md` - Claude Code discussion and learning about Spec Kit setup, CLI tools, and AI assistant configuration
   - `/Terminal-knowledge/Terminal 2.md` - Large codebase handling beyond context limits and GitHub Spec-Kit tools
   - `/Terminal-knowledge/Terminal 3.md` - Spec Kit installation and setup with Qwen Code integration (binary file with readable content)
   - `/Terminal-knowledge/Terminal 4.md` - Comprehensive summary of our Google Drive Receipt Parser implementation session

3. **SpecKit Commands**: Examine `.qwen/commands/` to understand the available SpecKit commands

4. **Project Constitution**: Review `.specify/memory/constitution.md` to understand the code quality and development principles that guide this project

## Next Steps

- Complete the actual implementation of the services described in the specifications
- Create the frontend interface components
- Integrate all services into a working application
- Add comprehensive testing following the defined test structure
- Document the SpecKit learning process for future reference

## Key Learnings

This project demonstrates that:
- SpecKit provides a systematic approach to software specification and planning
- The TDD approach built into the framework ensures testability from the start
- Early clarification of requirements reduces development rework
- Client-side architecture can be designed for privacy-conscious applications
- Proper separation of concerns improves maintainability

This repository serves as both a working example of the SpecKit methodology and a reference implementation for the Google Drive Receipt Parser application.
